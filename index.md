Welcome to my research website. My name is Zhengyan Lun and I'm currently a research associate scholar in the Department of Chemistry and Department of Physics at University of Cambridge. I did my Ph.D. in the Department of Materials Scheince and Engineering at University of California, Berkeley and Materials Sciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. My undergraduate was done at the Department of Chemistry and Materials Science in University of Science and Technology of China, majoring in Materials Physics.

My research interests focus on the design, synthesis, characterization and optimization of next-generation generation energy-storage materials. From a fundamental perspective, I start from basic physics and chemistry principles for materials design, and apply a wide range of advanced characterization techniques (such as X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, pair distribution function, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, interferometric scattering etc.) to elucidate the structure-property relationship of energy storage materials and their degradation mechanisms. From a practical persctive, I am also interested in applying engineering methods for the functional optimization of novel energy storage materials for potential commercialization.
