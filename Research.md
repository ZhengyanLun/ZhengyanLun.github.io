## Design and synthesis of next-generation energy storage materials

The tremendous success and growth of energy storage technology in a broad range of applications have long-lasting and far-reaching influence on our human society. Li-ion technology is so far the most promising and optimized component within the energy storage technology frame, which can further be divided into several sub-catagories, i.e., cathodes, anodes and electrolytes. Not only should we further enhance the capacity, rate capability and cycle life of various components, but also seek for less resource-constrained candidates for energy storage.

I am experienced in the design and synthesis of various class of energy storage materials, especially cation-disordered rocksalt (DRX) materials and Ni-rich NMC cathodes, the optimization of which can be achieved from the delicate manipulation of overall composition, long-range crystal structure and local short-range ordering as well.




## Development and application of advanced characterization techniques

The electrochemical performance of energy storage materials are primarily related to the structure of the materials and the reaction kinetics during operation. One must rely on various advanced characterization techniques, both *in-situ* (i.e., tracking the structure / kinetic information during the electrochemical cycling in real time) and *ex-situ* (i.e., stopping the components at different state of charge and performing various characterizations). I am a fan of developing and applying various techniques to probe the structure-property relationships and reaction kinetics in energy storage materials, including, but not limited to the following:

### X-ray diffraction (XRD)

XRD is a traditional, yet powerful tool to track the long-range crystal structure of the materials. *Operando* XRD provides valuable information of the phase behavior during the electrochemical cycling of energy storage materials in real time, and can be applied to understand the stability and reaction kinetics of the material upon cycling. 

### Pair-distribution function (PDF)

PDF is a bulk-sensitive local structure characterization technique, which can probe the local 


### Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

### Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (ssNMR)

### X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)

### Ultrafast interferometric scattering (iSCAT) optical microscopy
